# love_math

 Simple math game.
 Welcome to the Love Maths walkthrough project designed by Code Institute 
 (https://github.com/Code-Institute-Solutions/love-maths-2.0-sourcecode/tree/master). 
 In this case study I build a project following CI lessons from start to finish, 
 getting used to github and consolidate some Javascript along with HTML and CSS skills.
